### Abstract
We are concerned about how Netflix’s suggestion engine will allow the consumers to have a more viewer friendly experience, due to the rising popularity of this
streaming platform today. To address this concern, we plan to analyze user rating size in relation to rating to explore the influence of Rating level on user
rating score based on Netflix's search engines.
### Keywords
Algorithms, suggestion engines, Netflix, streaming platform
### Introduction
In this project we decided to use a Kaggle dataset display Netflix shows and their ratings. Since the dataset incorporates Netflix’s suggestion engine into the
aggregated data, our group was thinking about exploring research questions relating to its impact and extension. As such we’d like to explore how Netflix’s
suggestion engine allow the consumers to have a more viewer friendly experience? How does their suggestion engine impact a show’s ratings and vice versa of how
does show’s ratings impact Netflix’s suggestion engine? Does release year have an impact on the suggestion engine? Do ratings make an impact on when Netflix
decides to stop hosting a show? The possibilities with this dataset are numerous. We chose this dataset because we wanted to work with a topic that was
entertaining and interesting but still prompting. I think that since we all have our personal experiences with Netflix, when working with this data, we are more
invested into our research and finding out the results since they have a direct relation to us as part of Netflix’s userbase. Furthermore, the impact of our
findings is substantial considering the scope of Netflix’s impact. Especially during the pandemic, their userbase has grown significantly when people searched for
entertainment options during lockdown. Since it also provides convenience from the comfort of your own home, I believe that any of our findings can make a
substantial impact.
### Related Work
The possibilities of streaming has shifted our world through genres, labels and categories our daily media consumption. Netflix uses machine learning and
algorithms to break down its viewer's recommended shows and predicts other shows to keep their consumers interested. Take the trending Korean drama, Squid Game,
for example, how did this show become so popular on this streaming platform? While the Korean show has its personal labeled genre, it also contains "hyper-specific
categories" that are stored into "meta-data - the behind-the-scenes codes that support platforms like Spotify" (Beer). According to the Wired article, they gather
"what people watch, what they watch after, what they watch before, what they watched a year ago, what they've watched recently, and what time of day" and Netflix
combine this information "with more data aimed at understanding the content of the shows." This information from their viewers then gets categorized and analyzed
into multiple taste groups that are used for machine learning algorithms. This method is implemented all across the word. A research study conducted by Gomez-Uribe
and Neil Hunt indicated there is a collection of recommender algorithm that Netflix uses such as the personalized video ranker (PVR) and Top N video ranker
algorithm that catalogs videos for each member profile on the homepage of Netflix, or the video-video similarity algorithm for Netflix's Because You Watched (BYW)
recommendations. There are numerous algorithms implemented with Netflix's suggestion engines and with this project, we will dive into how exactly this huge
streaming platform recommends similar shows through its User Rating Score, Rating Description, Release Year, Title, and more complete the user's Netflix
experience.
### The Dataset
We found this dataset on the website Kaggle about Netflix shows. The dataset was created by a software engineer named Chase Willden. He completed his Masters of
Science at Boston University in data analytics. The data was collected because the author wanted to understand the distribution of the Netlfix show ratings as it
hasn't really been understood by anyone due to the large number of Netflix shows. Since gathering data for each show individually would take a very long time,
Chase collected the data by using the Netflix suggestion engine which allowed him to gather data for one show and those that are recommended based on the certain
selected show. There are 496 unique rows in this dataset with seven columns that contains strings, integers, and decimals. Some possible limitations or problems
with this data is that the ratings are completely based on Netflix users which doesn't necessarily represent the entire population of people who watch the shows.
There are people who could possibly watch the shows on TV without Netflix or even pirate them which means that the data isn't necessarily accurate to the entire
population. There are also people won't don't necessarily have access to Netflix meaning that the data can only represent a certain population without making
assumptions about what some people "would like".

### Limitations & Challenges
While doing research, we might run into challenges with misinformation and biased resources. Because Netflix has millions of subscribers that watch a variety of
shows, it would be challenging for us to analyze how interactions with Netflix can alter the preferences. Moreover, the designated factors such as rating that
could impact the interests limit our ability to better understand what is the main influencer to these recommendations. There are also data limitations in which
the data can not represent all subscribers, this will create bias in our findings. The time of a day, devices, and duration are some of the existing data to be
used as inputs for Netflix to process in their algorithms, but duration might not be accurate especially if one kept playing shows without watching. We need to
address more broadly the accuracy of data and view it more holistically.
### Summary Information
Write a summary paragraph of findings that includes the 5 values calculated from your summary information R script
```
data <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/info-201b-wi22/exploratory-analysis-MiniPasta/main/archive/netflix_titles.csv?token=GHSAT0AAAAAABQJQPQGV54RWO526HV327CWYQ3FKJQ")
summary_info <- list()
summary_info$num_movies <- data %>%
filter(type == "Movie") %>% summarize(count = n()) %>% pull(count)
summary_info$num_tv <- data %>%
filter(type == "TV Show") %>% summarize(count = n()) %>% pull(count)
summary_info$num_us <- data %>%
filter(country == "United States") %>% summarize(count = n()) %>% pull(count)
summary_info$num_2021 <- data %>%
filter(release_year == "2021") %>% summarize(count = n()) %>% pull(count)
summary_info$num_inttv <- data %>%
filter(listed_in == "International TV Shows") %>% summarize(count = n()) %>% pull(count)
View(summary_info)
```
This data include the number of unique movies, the number of unique TV Shows,
amount in us, amount  in 2021 and amount that are listed as international tv shows
### Table
```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=F, message=F, code = readLines ("aggregate table script.R")}
source("aggregate table script.R")
```
The purpose of thies table is to show numerically, the change in number of movies and tv shows over the progression of the years adding on you can see more clearly the differences between years for movies or tv shows and infer why the difference occurred.
### Chart 1
What are the top 10 directors with the largest number of movies?
```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=F, message=F, code = readLines ("chart1.R")}
print(test)
```
The bar plot tells us that Rajiv Chilaka has directed the largest number of movies, the number is 19, Raúl Campos, Jan Suter has directed the second largest number
of movies, the number if 18, Suhas Kadav has directed the third largest number of movies, the number is 16.
### Chart 2
```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=F, message=F, code = readLines ("chart2.R")}
print(test2)
```
We chose this chart in order to  see all the types of ratings that exists in Netflix's streaming service and also compare it to the release year of that show or
movie. This furthermore reveals a history of the industrial discourses surrounding Netflix's audience data and concludes the discussion of streaming audience data
that situates in the emerging's realities of "popular" television in the context the medium's broader transformation and continuities.
### Chart 3
```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=F, message=F, code = readLines ("chart3.R")}
print(test3)
```
The purpose of including this chart is to see the difference in the trends between movies and tv shows over the course of the years.There's a chance that people prefer movies now today versus tv shows or vice versa. This can also give a perspective on the entertainment industry.Looking at this graph, we can see that the growth in movie is much steeper than that of tv shows which indicates that people today have preferred movies over tv shows on Netflix.

### Introduction
There is a huge issue in America about the color of justice; racial and ethnic disparity in state jails. Black Americans are incarcerated in state prisons across the country at a much higher rate than whites. This report will analyze the rates of incarceration for white, black, latinx, native americans, asian americans and pacific islanders, as well as other races all across the United States from 1970-2018.
Using incarceration collected by the Vera Institute, the variables I have chosen to are races, jail population, and state data across various races. In my data visualizations, I have chosen to focus on the differing impacts of incarcerations on all the races respectively and seeing the trend that this has on different population groups over the years.
### Summary Information: Relevant Values of Interest from the raw Incarceration data
#### What is the average value of my variable across all the counties (in the current year)?
**Warning**: This table indicates the average value of the total population of all races across all the counties the United States in 2018 (the current most year in the dataset) so it will be very *very* long.
```{r,echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
source('summary.R')
kable(all_race_data)
```
####  Where is my variable the highest / lowest?
The highest mean population in 2018 for AAPI groups was 286.4.
The highest mean population in 2018 for the Black american group was 5024.
The highest mean population in 2018 for the Latinx american group was 8728.
The highest mean population in 2018 for the other race group was 608.
The highest mean population in 2018 for the Native american group was 379.
The highest mean population in 1992 for the White american group was 4577.
*After almost 30 years from the present day in 2022, the highest mean of the population among all races in jail would be the latinx group, while the lowest mean of the population among all races would be the natives group*
The highest mean population in 1992 for AAPI groups was 246.
The highest mean population in 1992 for the Black american group was 9826.31
The highest mean population in 1992 for the Latinx american group was 9127.94
The highest mean population in 1992 for the other race group was 0.
The highest mean population in 1992 for the Native american group was 172.
The highest mean population in 1992 for the White american group was 4702.49.
*In 1992, the highest average of the population among all races in jail would be Black Americans and the lowest would be the Native Americans.*
####  How much has my variable change over the last N years?
**Warning**: This table indicates the the total population of all races across the United States from 1970 to 2018 so it will be very *very* long.

### The Dataset
The dataset was collected by the Vera Institute of Justice. The Vera Institute of Justice, founded in 1961, is an independent nonprofit national research and policy organization in the United States. Based primarily in New York. There is a total of 7 features and 49 observations on my Jail Annual Population Based on Race in the US and within Washington. My data frame of Total Jail Population per State in 1970 and 2018 has a total of 8 features and 1,876 observations. This data was collected to tackle the most pressing injustices of our day: from the causes and consequences of mass incarceration, racial disparities, and the loss of public trust in law enforcement, to the unmet needs of the vulnerable, the marginalized, and those harmed by crime and violence. Some ethical questions to consider when working with this data is how does one define jail and how does one define prison? Why is there a disparities between certain populations in such confinement? Is there more analysis that needs to be done with the dataset? Some possible limitations with this data is that there is no data that goes even further back before the 1970s that can further shows a different trend than what is being seen here.
### Map
```{r,echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
source('2018map.R')
print(map2018)
```
The first map organizes the data into a map to show the total jail population per state in 2018. This map indicates a large jail population in states like California, Texas, and Florida. These also happen to be very populated states with major cities with a large and diverse racial population. The Midwestern states shows a much lower crime rate in comparison to the previous states as mentioned. This map shows a general scheme of what the jail population looks like in 2018.

I wanted to compare the total jail population from 2018 to the very beginning of this data set, in 1970, when the data was first collected. The total jail population in California is still the most in comparison to the rest of the United States. However, after one had reviewed the legend on the right hand, one can see that the jail population in 1970 is equivalent to the jail population of states like New Mexico in 2018. Putting that into perspective, we can clearly see that there is an increase in jail population across the United States since the 70s. Now why might that be?
Over the last 40 years, America there is over a 200% increase in the jail population for California. These trends have resulted in jail overcrowding and fiscal burdens on states to accommodate a rapidly expanding penal system, despite increasing evidence that large-scale incarceration is not an effective means of achieving public safety.
### Variable Comparison Chart
```{r,echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
source('variablecomparisonracechart1.R')
print(bar_plot1)
```
This variable comparison chart the different diversity in jail annually from 1970 to 2018 in the United States. However, this chart cannot definitively depict the trend as clearly as it should. The following chart below will allow one to see a much cleaner interpretation of the data. The data depicts individual diversity groups and overall, there has been a large increase in terms of racial population across all the groups in jail.
```{r,echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
source('variablecomparisonracechart2.R')
print(bar_plot_2)
```
This variable comparison chart does a much better job of depicting the trend of racial population in jail annually compared to the previous chart. One can clearly see and understand the difference of racial population in jail with a more cleaner representation of the trend. The population that is presented with the highest number of annual population in the US is the White American population, followed by the Black American population, Latinx American population, and so on.
### Trends Over Time Chart
```{r,echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
source('timetrendchart1.R')
print(time_chart_year)
```
Now you might be wondering, why is it that white Americans are incarcerated in jail much higher than black population? Would this trend go against what you've known when it comes to talking about racial and ethnic disparities in jail? This trend really surprised me to see since there has been so many talks about racial disparities in this country in terms of the BLM movements. However, we should consider that this dataset does not encapsulate the full scope of the BLM movement in 2020.
This chart shows the diversity of jail population of the United States from 1970 to 2018. The chart shows an increasing trend of white Americans being in jail as the majority in comparison to the minority of the populations. However, with this data, it is a few years before the movements and so we are not able to see the trend of the disparity. The number of Black American in jail across the US is still relatively high when comparing to other minority races.

The second time trend chart shows the diversity of jail population of Washington state from 1970 to 2018. This chart similarly indicates an increasing trend in the white Americans population. These two charts show a consistent trend in the white American population annually, while the rest of the minority races remained relatively low. This is interesting due to the fact that the period from 2000 to 2018, one would expect that the crime rate would increase drastically, but only one population increased periodically from the rest.
With the analysis of the data, there is a staggering difference of White Americans population in jail annually. However, the words jail and prison are often interchangeably in casual use, jail is typically used to refer to smaller, more local facilities, in which people are incarcerated for short periods of time, while prison is used to refer to larger facilities (such as state and federal prisons) in which people are incarcerated for long periods.
